## 📖 Project Overview
Plastic straws contribute significantly to global pollution, harming marine wildlife and ecosystems. **EcoStraw Solutions** is a product design project that applies the **Design Thinking Methodology** to create a practical, user-friendly alternative to single-use plastics.

This repository contains the source code for the project website, which serves as a digital showcase for our research, prototypes, and final product design.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Interactive 3D Prototype:** A fully interactive 3D model of our bamboo straw rendered using **Three.js**, allowing users to rotate and inspect the design.
* **Modern Glassmorphism UI:** A responsive, aesthetically pleasing interface with frosted glass navigation and smooth scroll animations.
* **Document Archive:** Integrated PDF viewers for the detailed project report and presentation slides.
* **Multimedia Gallery:** A side-by-side showcase of prototyping snapshots and a video walkthrough.

## 🛠️ The Design Thinking Process
[cite_start]We followed the 5-stage Design Thinking framework to ensure our solution met real user needs[cite: 90].

1.  **Empathize:** Conducted interviews to understand why users dislike paper straws (soggy) and metal straws (cold feel).
2.  **Define:** Problem Statement: *"Users need a durable, hygienic, and comfortable straw for daily use that doesn't harm the environment"*.
3.  **Ideate:** Brainstormed solutions like detachable designs, silicone tips, and travel cases.
4.  **Prototype:** Developed physical models using organic bamboo and stainless steel (Grade 304).
5.  **Test:** Refined the product based on user feedback, adding a cleaning brush and portability pouch.
